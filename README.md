PowerBI HRD

This is a home project that I used to thoroughly master PowerBI. A detailed description of my astronomy background, motivation, and implementation can be found here:

Two bigger files (a txt and a csv) belongs to this project. If you want to try out my PowerBI HRD, you need to download them from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-PcszEwNkKbiPsU8XLxKmuRk84HECS-T?usp=sharing

If you copy the files to the same folder, it should work.
